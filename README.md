# Credit Card Fraud Detection using AdaBoost and Majority Voting

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model utilizes AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) as the primary classification algorithm, combined with majority voting for improved accuracy and robustness.

**Key Features:**

* **AdaBoost:** 
    * Employs an ensemble learning approach to combine multiple weak classifiers (e.g., decision trees) into a strong classifier.
    * Adaptively adjusts the weights of training samples based on their misclassification rates, focusing on the most difficult-to-classify instances.
* **Majority Voting:** 
    * Enhances the model's performance by aggregating predictions from multiple AdaBoost classifiers.
    * Improves generalization and reduces overfitting.
* **Data Preprocessing:** 
    * Includes necessary steps such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values.
* **Model Evaluation:** 
    * Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for comprehensive model assessment.

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

3. Data Preparation:

Prepare your credit card transaction dataset (e.g., CSV format) with features such as:
Amount
Time
Customer information
Transaction history
Location information
Preprocess the data as per the provided scripts.
4. Training:

Run the training script:
Bash

python train_model.py 
5. Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict fraudulent transactions on new data:
Bash

python predict.py 
Model Architecture:

AdaBoost Classifier:
Utilizes a specified number of weak classifiers (e.g., decision trees).
Each classifier is trained on a weighted version of the training data.
Weights are adjusted after each iteration to focus on misclassified instances.
Majority Voting:
Combines predictions from multiple AdaBoost classifiers.
The final prediction is determined by the majority vote among the classifiers.
Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using various metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
AUC-ROC
Results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
